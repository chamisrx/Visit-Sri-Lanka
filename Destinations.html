          <p>Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It is of
            international significance and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
            According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is the country's last viable
            area of primary tropical rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered
            rare. 50% of Sri Lankan's endemics species of animals (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and
            fish species). It is home to 95% endemic birds. The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland
            rain forests ecoregion, was saved from the worst of commercial logging by its inaccessibility, and was
            designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.</p>

          <h3>SIGIRIYA</h3>
          <p>Sigiriya or Lion Rock (Sinhala: සීගිරිය) is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale
            District near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province, Sri Lanka. The name refers to a site of
            historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive dst-column of rock around 180
            meters (590 ft) high. According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Culavamsa, this site was selected by
            King Kashyapa (477 – 495 AD) for his new capital. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock
            he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site.
            It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning.</p>

          <p>Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic; commonly known as the ශ්‍රී දළදා මාළිගාව (Glorious Tooth Temple), is a
            Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of
            Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an
            important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of
            the country. The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. The temple of the tooth is a World Heritage
            Site mainly due to the temple and the relic. Rituals are performed three times daily: at dawn, at noon, and
            in the evenings. On Wednesdays, there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with a herbal preparation made from
            scented water and fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya; this holy water is believed to contain
            healing powers and is distributed to those present.</p>

            There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and
            goddesses. Prehistoric Sri Lankans would have lived in these cave complexes before the arrival of Buddhism

            attributed to a local Ceylonese builder, P. K. Appuhami, in consultation with British engineers. It is
            located in Demodara, between Ella and Demodara railway stations. The surrounding area has seen a steady
            increase of tourism due to the bridge's architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby
            hillsides. The work came to a standstill, leading the locals to build the bridge with stone bricks and
            cement, but without steel.</p>
